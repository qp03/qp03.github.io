                    Branding is a way you establish an image of your business in your customer's eyes - it's an expierience. The foundation of your brand is your logo. Your website, packaging, merchandise and social media presence, all of which should intergrate your logo, communicate your brand.

                <h2>My Brand</h2>
                <p>
                    In this branding project, I produced an iced coffee brand. I wanted to deliver an easy go-to drink that boosts your energy whenever it's needed. These following series of images were created to promote my brand on social media platforms.
