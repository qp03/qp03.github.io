                    Branding is a way you establish an image of your business in your customer's eyes - it's an expierience. The foundation of your brand is your logo. Your website, packaging, merchandise and social media presence, all of which should intergrate your logo, communicate your brand.
                </p>
                <h2>My Brand</h2>
                <p>
                    In this branding project, I produced an iced coffee brand. I wanted to deliver an easy go-to drink that boosts your energy whenever it's needed. These following series of images were created to promote my brand on social media platforms.

                <p>
                    These black and white prints were developed in the darkroom. I used small objects (such as, different kinds of nets and ety pill packages) to create an abstract imagery

                <p>
                    A store window is no longer just a useful space that a retailer uses to promote their products. They are created to entice, enthuse and challange the consumer.

                <h2>Fear Factory</h2>
                <p>
                    In this project, I had chosen Fear Factory Wellington as our retailer it is a haunted house located on Cuba Street. I produced a crate design that successfully reflects the retailer's aesthetic.
