                <p>
                    Branding is a way you establish an image of your business in your customer's eyes - it's an expierience. The foundation of your brand is your logo. Your website, packaging, merchandise and social media presence, all of which should intergrate your logo, communicate your brand.
                </p>
                <h2>My Brand</h2>
                <p>
                    In this branding project, I produced an iced coffee brand. I wanted to deliver an easy go-to drink that boosts your energy whenever it's needed. These following series of images were created to promote my brand on social media platforms.

                    These black and white prints were developed in the darkroom. I used small objects (such as, different kinds of nets and ety pill packages) to create an abstract imagery
