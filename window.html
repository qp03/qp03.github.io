                    A store window is no longer just a useful space that a retailer uses to promote their products. They are created to entice, enthuse and challange the consumer.

                    In this project, I had chosen Fear Factory Wellington as our retailer it is a haunted house located on Cuba Street. I produced a crate design that successfully reflects the retailer's aesthetic.
